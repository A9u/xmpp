// Form is a challenge that presents or receives a data form as specified in

// If Form is used by a client, f is called and passed the form sent by the
// server.
// The returned form should be a response to the sent form.
// If Form is used by a server, f is called once with a nil form and should
// return a form to be sent to the client; it is then called again with the
// clients response at which point a nil form can be returned to terminate the
// exchange, or a second form to be sent to the client can be returned.
