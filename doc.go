// Package xmpp provides functionality from the Extensible Messaging and
// Presence Protocol, sometimes known as "Jabber".
//
// It is subdivided into several packages; this package provides functionality
// for establishing an XMPP session, feature negotiation (including an API for
// defining your own stream features), and low-level connection and stream
// manipulation.
// The jid package provides an implementation of the XMPP address format defined
// in RFC 7622.
//
// Be advised: This API is still unstable and is subject to change.
