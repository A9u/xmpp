<!--
First, replace "pkgname" in the title with the package for which you're making
this request. Eg. "xmpp:" or "roster:". If it applies to all packages, use the
string "all". If you're unsure, or are requesting a new package, leave the
prefix off.

Then, please start with a clear and concise description of what the problem is
and why it should be fixed.

This should *not* include a solution. For example, say "I am having a hard time
sending files using this library and propose an API for sending files", don't
list an API for using Jingle File Transfer.

The actual solution and other alternatives will be included in a design doc if
it is necessary. After you file your feature request, feel free to go ahead and
submit a PR with a design doc, or we will follow up if we think one is
necessary.

Add your description here.

<!--
Add additional links to design docs, related issues, etc. as needed. Use the
mellium.im redirects where possible, don't link straight to the source code
hosting. eg.

  **Design doc:** https://mellium.im/design/19_ibb  
  **Related:** https://mellium.im/issue/13  
  **See also:** https://mellium.im/docs/extensions

You may replace the links with "TODO" before design docs are merged or PRs are
created. Be careful to add a double space on the end of each line or the
Markdown renderer won't insert newlines!

**Design doc:** TODO
