// These error conditions are not in the main xmpp package to prevent naming
// conflicts with similarly named stanza error conditions and because they are
// less frequently used. Most people will want to use the facilities of the
// mellium.im/xmpp package and not create stream errors directly.

	// <restricted-xml/>, and <unsupported-encoding/>. However, the more specific
	// errors are RECOMMENDED.

	// Conflict is sent when the server either (1) is closing the existing stream
	// for this entity because a new stream has been initiated that conflicts with
	// the existing stream, or (2) is refusing a new stream for this entity
	// because allowing the new stream would conflict with an existing stream
	// (e.g., because the server allows only a certain number of connections from
	// the same IP address or allows only one server-to-server stream for a given
	// domain pair as a way of helping to ensure in-order processing.
