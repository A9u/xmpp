# Contributing

Bugs and feature requests can be started by opening an [issue][issues].
Discussions should happen on [the MUC][joinmuc].

If you want to contribute a pull request, make sure you do the following first:

  - Format all code with `go fmt`
  - Write documentation comments for any new public identifiers
  - Write tests for your code
  - Follow Go best practices

If you're not sure where to begin, grab any of the issues labeled
[`trivial`][trivial], and if you need help with any of this, don't be afraid to
ask! Try joining [dev@muc.mellium.im][joinmuc].
